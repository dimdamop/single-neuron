The performance of a single linear artificial neuron model when used for a regression task. The neuron model has been trained with batch gradient descent on the root mean square (RMSE) loss. The learning rate is equal to {0}. Each datapoint of the plot corresponds to the RMSE loss at the end of the corresponding epoch, as computed on the validation set. The dotted line represented the performance of a standard linear regression model for the same training and validation sets..format(lrate))
